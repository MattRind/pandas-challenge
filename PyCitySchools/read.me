Note: this summary is also in the Jupyter Notebook file:
There are 15 unique schools in our school district, with a total district student population of a little under 40,000 (39,170 students). Our total budget district-wide is around $25 million ($24,649,428). Academically, the district-wide average math score is 78.99 and average reading score is 81.88. The percentage of students in the district who passed math (score greater or equal to 70) is 74.98%, while the percentage of students in the district who passed reading is 85.81%. The percentage of students in the district who passed both math and reading is 65.17%.
The top performing schools, in terms of both math and reading passing rates were Cadera, Thomas, Griffin, Wilson and Pena High Schools (the highest performing was Cadera High). The schools that had the lowest performing overall (math and reading) passing rates were Rodiquez, Figueroa, Huang, Hernandez and Johnson High Schools.
An interesting trend was noticed that the more a school spent per student, overall academic performance actually declined, including average math scores, average reading scores, percent passing reading and percent passing math. Small sized schools (less than 1000 students) and medium size schools (1000-2000 students) had similar overall academic performance (math and reading) in the district with 89.9% and 90.6%, respectively (on average among schools of like size category), of students passing in both math and reading. However large sized schools with over 2000 students had an alarmedly the lowest passing percentage of both math and reading with only 58.3% passing on average among all schools in the large size category. In large schools, students had lower scores in math (70.0% passing) compared to reading (82.8% passing). A similar trend was observed when analyzing performance against school type, since all 7 district schools are considered large: 53.7% of students in district schools had passing grades in both reading and math on average among district schools, whereas 90.4% of students in charter schools had passing grades in both reading and math. Two charter schools in our district are considered small, 5 are medium sized and 1 is large sized.
